# hello-world
604B- My first repository 
Lucia Lopez : This class is kind of confusing. 
I dont understand how to use use different Markdown elements but I will try. 
**Hello World** that doesnt quite look bold to me...actually it is 
*Hello World*. it works! 
H~2~O why did that not turn into a subscript?
x^2^ I guess it doesnt actually change it??
==I need to understand how to use GitHub ASAP=  it doesn't actually highlight???
